                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Sixty years ago, this was the site of Phil&#x2019;s Drive In. Phil, born Paul Draginsky in Odessa, Russia, was my father. The &#x201C;stand,&#x201D; as we called it, boasted 19-cent hamburgers, 25-cent hot dogs, 39-cent
                                        pastrami dips and other fast food fare. The business was the pinnacle of my father&#x2019;s working life. Before this, he had been a truck driver for a bakery. The hamburger joint was on his route. He knew business
                                        was booming because he delivered a huge number of hamburger and hot dog buns. So when the place went up for sale in the mid-1950s, my father raised the cash.<span id="more-156732"></span></p>

                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Business continued its upswing. In 1960, Dad bought a brand-new gunmetal gray Thunderbird and a $600 lifetime membership in the Beverly Hills Health Club. He opened a sandwich shop in the supermarket across the street
                                        from the stand, and another hamburger stand on Alvarado Street. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">His family back in Cleveland must have been proud, considering that my father had dropped out of East Technical High School for the allure of Amato&#x2019;s Pool Hall. The folks at home spoke Russian and Yiddish and
                                        had large family gatherings, just as in the old country. But my father wanted none of it. He was the youngest of six children, drawn to Cleveland&#x2019;s gangster class, and his love of sleek cars and natty suits
                                        was exceeded only by his love of gambling. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The success of the hamburger joint actually made his gambling worse. For the first time, he had money rolling in, people working for him and free time. From Alvarado Street it was 20 minutes (as the Thunderbird flies)
                                        to the Hollywood Park racetrack. It wasn&#x2019;t long before he was chasing losses. For years my parents had been fighting, always about gambling. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t see why you got married in the first place,&#x201D;
                                        my older brother Bill once said, back when he was about 12. Now their fighting was more frequent. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">First went our house, then the businesses, then (for a time) the marriage. My father somehow managed to rent a tiny studio in Beverly Hills. Mom and I were ensconced in a Culver City apartment, while Bill was on his
                                        own. Despite working dead-end jobs, my father continued gambling. How? Years later he would explain it to me: </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Guys at the club would say, &#x2018;Let&#x2019;s go to the track.&#x2019; I&#x2019;d tell them I&#x2019;m broke. And they&#x2019;d say &#x2018;Here&#x2019;s five hundred.&#x2019; I&#x2019;d tell them I don&#x2019;t
                                        know when I could pay it back. &#x2018;Do I look worried?&#x2019; they&#x2019;d say. What could I do?&#x201D; </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And then, sometime in the mid-1960s, that club membership paid off &#x2014; big time. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Harry, a friend from the club, tells my father: &#x201C;I got you a job. Pete wants to see you.&#x201D; Pete is a Beverly Hills bookie right out of central casting.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">My father tells Harry, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t know nothing about the bookmaking business.&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Harry is insistent: &#x201C;Just talk to him.&#x201D; So Pete and my father arrange to have breakfast.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Pete tells my father: &#x201C;I want you to start today.&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Start what?&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">&#x201C;Taking bets.&#x201D;</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Pete and my father drive to a dingy apartment complex off Santa Monica Boulevard. My father carries a suitcase to make it seem as if he&#x2019;s moving in. Pete explains the business: how the clients are known by their
                                        initials; the deadline for taking bets on a horse race; how to compute the odds on a three-horse parlay. The high school dropout catches on quickly. He makes a few mistakes but within a week or two, he&#x2019;s
                                        got the routine. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Some years later, he invited me to pay him a visit. I was in my 30s then, in town for a journalism conference, and I hadn&#x2019;t seen him for a few years. I walked apprehensively to the apartment, taking quick looks
                                        over my shoulder. When he opened the door, I saw that his hair had turned a distinguished gray, and his electric blue shirt concealed the start of midriff bulge. This was my father, giver of values, such as they
                                        were. Yet I couldn&#x2019;t deny my pride. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">There were pink betting slips spread across the desk, a phalanx of yellow pencils, several red pens and a tape recorder (to keep his clients honest). The only thing missing was a green eyeshade. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The job also involved payoffs and collections. I accompanied my father on one of these outings. The first client met our car at the appointed corner and slipped my father an envelope stuffed with bills. I glanced at
                                        my father. Here he was, in his element &#x2014; practically glowing &#x2014; counting the bills, a tiny cog in the billion-dollar business of illegal bookmaking. We drove on in anonymity, two certified members of
                                        the underworld. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">By this time my father was pulling down $400 a week (tax free, of course), and holiday bonuses of $2,000. Incredibly, his own gambling was curtailed. &#x201C;No time,&#x201D; he said. And he found that he got the same
                                        rush handling the action, finally having the house on his side. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Retirement came after the cops broke down the door of the apartment. Was he scared? &#x201C;I&#x2019;ll you tell what,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;After I thought about it, I was glad it was cops who broke in.&#x201D;
                                        Armed thugs might not have been so friendly.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Pete paid a fine, and my father was released after a warning from the judge about the consequences of a repeat offense. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">My mother, who had taken my father back years earlier, now got him to agree to let her handle the money. When they vacationed in Vegas, she doled out his &#x201C;gambling allowance.&#x201D; But when they moved to an
                                        assisted living place in Pasadena, Calif., he finally had to give his gambling up. My father was miserable, and not long after, dementia took over his mind. He died on Oct. 9, 2004, at age 92, and was sent to his
                                        eternal reward with a pair of dice in his breast coat pocket. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">He would never again feel the sting of a losing bet.</p>
