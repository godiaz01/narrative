                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">My parents, former groovy college professors, had gone to this resort for years. It wasn&#x2019;t hard to understand that skinny-dipping in those quiet waters made them feel free and young. But my father had died two
                                        years before and my mother, now a slim, attractive 71-year-old widow, wanted to relive her best times, with children and grandchildren in tow. Any daughter with a shred of decency would do this for her mother.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">So, easily handling the lightest travel bag I had ever packed, I found myself standing at the gate of a nudist colony at Leucate, France, on a blazing July day, sweating through a cotton shirt. Somewhere inside the
                                        gates, my mother, younger sisters and their four female children had already settled into the rental apartment. (Unlike me, my sisters weren&#x2019;t fazed by this vacation. They both became college professors,
                                        too, and although they didn&#x2019;t walk around their homes without clothing, I&#x2019;m pretty sure I was the only one of us who had ever worn pantyhose.) </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As I walked through the complex, looking for my relatives, I saw families enjoying the pool and the beach, sitting on benches &#x2014; all naked except for sunglasses and chalky dabs of sunscreen. People stared at my
                                        clothing. A bare man on his balcony, apparently doing some home repair, put down his power drill and regarded me sourly. Finally, I heard my mother, walking briskly toward me, calling my name. I hugged her loosely,
                                        not daring to squeeze or look down. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Leucate is not the Riviera. Its nudist beaches are a destination for budget vacationers, mostly European families, who prefer to relax undressed. I learned that in this place, covered skin was forbidden outside the
                                        apartment. If you wanted to wear a burlap sack inside, go ahead. Outside, it was rude not to be nude. Nobody even thought of trying to go for a dip in the pool wearing a swimsuit.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> I decided to wear clothes inside our beachside rental. One of my nieces wore her underwear in solidarity with me. In some ways, this was like our usual family reunions: I was the cook, in a shirt and apron. In other
                                        respects it was different: the complete absence of our husbands and sons, and having to get undressed to go outside.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">On the beach each morning, I spread out a towel and lay on the sand, looking like a cod fillet in a fish market. A fillet with stretch marks and an odd pattern of moles across my middle. How I longed to wrap the towel
                                        around myself.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> The resort operated an entire buff village, with stores, a laundry (not that there was much to wash) and even a restaurant. We never ate there, but it must have been upscale because at the tables, each chair had a thin
                                        round of tissue paper (presumably disposable) for the comfort of bare-bottomed diners.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> When we ran out of fresh fruit, I went into the small grocery store. &#x201C;Maybe I&#x2019;m starting to adjust,&#x201D; I thought, as I shopped haunch to haunch with the other customers. I bought a small watermelon,
                                        and found that my imperfect French embarrassed me more than the sight of my breasts as I forked over the euros. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But after I got back to the apartment and cut into the fruit &#x2014; so perfect on the outside &#x2014; I found it was rotten within. My thriftiness overwhelmed my modesty, and I removed my T-shirt, stripped off my
                                        briefs and marched back to the store. If it was hard to buy produce without clothing and with a poor command of the language, it was more difficult to return it. Perhaps the poignant sight of a flat-chested, middle-aged
                                        American woman seeking to buy a voluptuous French melon melted the icy heart of the clerk. She found me another watermelon.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As I made my way back to the apartment, I passed an outdoor shower, where beachgoers rinsed off before going inside. A man about my age, balanced on one leg, was carefully rinsing the sand off his other leg &#x2014;
                                        a prosthetic that he held under the shower like a baby.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This was the moment when I should have accepted my public nudity. After all, if a one-legged man is O.K. with his body, then a dermatologically challenged woman should be O.K. too. I was not.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I could guess why my parents loved this place. This trip was my mother&#x2019;s gift; a way to show me the beautiful people she and my dad had been when they were together.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">But instead of being grateful, I was anxious, lumpy, not the least groovy. The sight of my mother&#x2019;s bare body made me as dizzy as the sight of my own blood. It was too much truth.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> Still, as a devoted daughter, I would do anything for my mother. Once.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody"> The next summer, my husband and I took our boys on vacation to the Canadian Rockies. I stuffed my luggage with socks, thermal underwear and an enormous flannel nightgown. I wore every single garment. My skin never saw
                                        daylight.</p>
