                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Two years ago, when I was in the midst of treatment for breast cancer, Susan, a dear friend, showed up on my doorstep with a bag of yarn and two wooden needles. &#x201C;I am going to teach you to knit,&#x201D; she announced.
                                        &#x201C;This is what got me through my own horrible year of treatment.&#x201D; </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I admired the skein of yarn, its intricate pattern of moss and teal and eggplant. I could see that it would yield a stunning scarf or hat, one I would be proud to wear on my still-bald head. I listened while Susan enumerated
                                        the many pleasures of knitting &#x2014; its restorative nature, the way it tamps down anxiety and frees your mind for contemplation. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">And then I put her off. &#x201C;Another day,&#x201D; I said. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m just a little tired&#x201D; &#x2014; shamelessly using chemo as an excuse. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Susan did not take no for an answer. Through emails, phone calls and the occasional drop-in visit over the next few weeks, she gently pressed me: &#x201C;Come on, let&#x2019;s get started. Ten minutes. That&#x2019;s
                                        all it&#x2019;ll take to get you going.&#x201D; But I could not bring myself to open that bag of yarn.<span id="more-156652"></span></p>

                                    </div>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Susan didn&#x2019;t know that there was a time in my 20s when I knew how to knit, and actually made several entire wool sweaters. When I was an impoverished graduate student, I needed a birthday gift for David, then
                                        my fianc&#xE9;, now my husband. My mother, an avid knitter, not only bought the needles and yarn (a lovely heather gray, as I recall); she also guided me every step of the way. David wore his cable-knit sweater
                                        so often that the elbows frayed. After that I knitted several more sweaters, cerulean for myself, rose for my sister. And then I put the needles down and never picked them up again.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I hadn&#x2019;t wondered why I no longer knitted until Susan forced the issue. It was then I started thinking of my mother. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">My mother was one of the most dynamic and brilliant women I have ever known. She was also mercurial and unfocused. This is a woman who, while raising four daughters, taught English literature at a community college,
                                        got her Ph.D. in women&#x2019;s studies and became a state legislator. She lived in a constant state of interrogation: of herself, the people around her and the wider world. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">She moved from one passion to the next like a tornado moving across a flat landscape, sweeping up everything in its path and flinging it aside &#x2014; astrology, feminist activism, organic gardening. Knitting was no
                                        different. For a few years, skeins of yarn piled up in baskets around the house. There weren&#x2019;t enough humans in my mother&#x2019;s orbit to wear all the scarves and sweaters and hats she knitted. And then,
                                        as suddenly as she started, she lost interest, leaving needles still entwined in half-finished fragments.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This was around the same time that my mother&#x2019;s Ph.D. dissertation, a biography of a white female Southern labor organizer, was published by a renowned university press. The glowing reviews brought her a contract
                                        to write a book about a New York feminist intellectual who was at the forefront of many important political struggles of the 20th century. My mother signed the contract. And then she made choices at every opportunity
                                        that led her further away from the book. She got involved in local political skirmishes and distracting personal disputes, and spent hours preparing for and cleaning up after lunch parties. She agreed to put her
                                        home on the local &#x201C;historic homes&#x201D; tour. She dug up and replanted dahlias. She rearranged the living room furniture and dumped out drawers, trying, with limited luck, to sort them. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">As each year bled into the next, my mother resolved to find the time to write the book &#x2014; time that inevitably evaporated for one reason or another. The editor was growing impatient. Dozens of yet-to-be-transcribed
                                        cassette tapes from my mother&#x2019;s interviews spilled out of boxes in her study. It weighed on her heavily. And still she didn&#x2019;t &#x2014; couldn&#x2019;t &#x2014; finish. Was she intimidated by the material?
                                        Ambivalent about her relationship to the subject? Overwhelmed by all the data? Undoubtedly; she said so many times. But doesn&#x2019;t every writer face these roadblocks? Why was it so impossible for her to finish?</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">The subject of my mother&#x2019;s still-unwritten biography died in 2007, at the age of 97. My mother died six years later, after a sudden and unexpected stroke at the age of 73, just as I was beginning radiation therapy,
                                        eight months after starting cancer treatment. Those cassette tapes are still in her study, along with her manila files arranged by subject, reference books taking up half a dozen shelves. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Annie Dillard once wrote, &#x201C;How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.&#x201D; This line has been a touchstone for me as I&#x2019;ve struggled to find time to write fiction while raising three
                                        boys, teaching and working as a freelance editor. Ms. Dillard&#x2019;s words remind me that it is easy to let days go by without writing, but in doing so I am making a statement about what I value, what matters
                                        most to me. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">When I start a new novel and find myself diverted by domestic activities, many of which I genuinely enjoy, I panic that I will never write another word. So, consciously and unconsciously, I have laid down certain rules
                                        for myself. I will not serve lunch to anyone in the middle of a workday. I rarely rearrange my furniture or cabinets; once I find a drawer for something, it stays there. I don&#x2019;t garden. And I don&#x2019;t
                                        knit. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Those stitches could be words. Knitting, for me, became a symbol of the oppressiveness of women&#x2019;s traditional roles as cooks, floor scrubbers and menders &#x2014; ephemeral work that robbed them of time and energy
                                        and kept them tied to hearth and home, far from the wider (male) world of important insights and discoveries. My own work has felt so culled from the margins, so hard won, that the idea of doing just about anything
                                        creative with my hands other than clutching a Pilot P-500 pen and scribbling words on a white college-ruled legal pad has felt like a betrayal.</p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">This is absurd, of course. It&#x2019;s not as if there&#x2019;s a quantifiable amount of creative energy, and if I knit I will use it up. For many people &#x2014; including Susan, who is a painter &#x2014; the opposite
                                        is true. What her gentle prodding forced me to recognize is that my disdain for knitting hid a deeper truth: that I was afraid I would die, like my mother, with my own work unfinished. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">I need to let my mother &#x2014; and myself &#x2014; off the hook. She lived the life she chose to live. Fully intellectually and emotionally engaged, she had streams of friends, and was married for 50 years to my devoted
                                        father. She left behind four daughters who benefited from her devotion to art and culture. She planted, she sewed, she simmered, she knitted. I have to believe that if she had genuinely wanted to finish the book,
                                        she would have. </p>
                                    <p class="story-body-text" itemprop="articleBody">Susan&#x2019;s yarn and needles look pretty in a bowl on a shelf in my study. But they have come to feel like a rebuke. In honor of my mother, I am going to take those knitting needles out of the bag and give Susan
                                        a call. These words are meant to be an essay. That yarn is meant to be a hat. </p>
