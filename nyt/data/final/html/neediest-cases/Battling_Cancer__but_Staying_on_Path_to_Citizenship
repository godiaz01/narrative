                            <p>Yong Ning Dai, 74, recently took up baking, making a vanilla sponge cake with bananas, fresh whipped cream and just the right amount of sweetness. He did not hone his baking skills during the hours of free time that often fill
                                the days of the elderly, but while doing odd jobs at bakeries around Flushing, Queens.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dai began working as a young boy in Shanghai, and after years of labor in a textile factory and study at a night school, he became a textile engineer. </p>
                            <p>In 2000, at the age of 68, he retired from his position at the factory and moved to the United States at his daughter&#x92;s request. He and his wife believed that it was their duty to help raise their grandchildren. </p>
                            <p>Mr. Dai, however, said he felt out of place at his daughter and son-in-law&#x92;s home in Maryland.</p>
                            <p>&#x93;He felt they belittled him,&#x94; said Jane Qiu, Mr. Dai&#x92;s social worker and translator. Mr. Dai had a falling out with his daughter and in 2002 decided to move to Queens, with just $400 in his pocket, while his
                                wife stayed behind in Maryland. </p>
                            <p>&#x93;At first, he thought, in Flushing there&#x92;s no language barrier, but the reality was not like that,&#x94; Ms. Qiu said, translating for Mr. Dai. </p>
                            <p>Although language was less of a problem in Flushing, where there is a large Mandarin-speaking population, Mr. Dai&#x92;s age proved to be an unexpected obstacle. Employers told him he was too old to work.</p>
                            <p> Just as he was feeling weary and hopeless, he saw a sign that offered work passing out restaurant menus. One day, he dropped some menus off at the Self-Help Prince Street Senior Center, an affiliate of <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/ujafederation_of_new_york/index.html?inline=nyt-org"
                                    title="More articles about UJA-Federation of New York">UJA-Federation of New York</a>, one of seven charities supported by The <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/new_york_times_neediest_cases_fund/index.html?inline=nyt-org"
                                    title="More articles about New York Times Neediest Cases Fund">New York Times Neediest Cases Fund</a>, and asked if anyone could help him.</p>
                            <p>&#x93;That afternoon, I still remember, he cried and talked about his misfortunes,&#x94; Ms. Qiu said. &#x93;I calmed him down.&#x94;</p>
                            <p>Ms. Qiu found him a part-time job at a housing center for the mentally ill, where he worked five days a week for four hours a day. He found a weekend job at a local bakery, where he would work up to 10 hours a day. Mr. Dai
                                soon had clambered his way toward full-time employment and was making $700 a week.</p>
                            <p>Then, he found out he had prostate cancer. </p>
                            <p>He tried to hide his disease from his boss at the center for fear of losing his job. However, in September 2005, nine months after the initial diagnosis, his boss learned about his illness. Despite Mr. Dai&#x92;s insistence
                                that he could continue to work, his boss told him he should spend time recovering and helped him apply for public assistance.</p>
                            <p>Unemployed and sick, Mr. Dai remembered that when he first moved to Queens in 2002, Ms. Qiu suggested that he become a United States citizen. He went to class, but because of his poor vision, he could not see the blackboard.
                                He jotted down the lesson, sentence by sentence. Then, at night, in his small, fluorescent-lighted room, he sat on his cot and reviewed his notes with the magnifying glass that he had around his neck.</p>
                            <p>He studied four hours a night, he said, and when his vision became so bad that he could not go to class, he asked a friend to take notes for him. Four days before his citizenship exam last year, Mr. Dai underwent cataract surgery.
                                Despite all the obstacles, he passed.</p>
                            <p>Mr. Dai is on the path toward reconciliation with his daughter, but he still refuses to live with her in Maryland. Xia Fei Zhou, 75, his wife, travels back and forth, now spending most of her time in New York with her sick
                                husband. </p>
                            <p>The cramped room they share, barely big enough for the cot they sleep on, is in a house with eight other residents on the second floor alone. There is only one kitchen and one bathroom on their floor, and the elderly couple
                                wait for their younger housemates to go to work before they get ready in the morning. </p>
                            <p>Housing is a major concern for the couple. Ms. Qiu has put aside $500 from the Neediest Cases Fund to provide the couple with a proper bed and linens, but they are waiting to find a space big enough to fit these amenities.
                                They have applied to a nonprofit group for housing for the elderly and are on a 10-year waiting list. </p>
