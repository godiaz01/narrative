																		<p><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;W</span>hat the hell do these fucking movie stars have to be unhappy about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The man in front of me in the Walmart check-out line was looking at the tabloids beside the cash register and talking in a loud voice to an older man who turned out to be his father, a fact I picked up on from their one-sided conversation, which I couldn&rsquo;t help but overhear, though I wished I could have tuned it out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean, really, Dad. What the fuck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The son wasn&rsquo;t a young man himself; in fact, I would hear him say that he was forty. His father, who was stocky with a red face and thick forearms, just went about the business of emptying his shopping cart. He wore a Harley-Davidson <span class="smallcaps">T</span>-shirt tucked neatly into his bluejeans and struck me as a man who might be unfazed by rough language. Or maybe Dad was just as embarrassed as I was for the son, who wore basketball shoes with the laces untied, a pair of loose-fitting shorts, a black tank top, and a gold chain around his neck. Had no one ever taught him to use his inside voice? He seemed quite pleased that he had a captive audience for his rant, jumping from subject to subject and peppering his speech with &ldquo;fucking&rdquo; this and &ldquo;fucking&rdquo; that. Some comments involved a wife (I&rsquo;m thinking she&rsquo;d have to be a tolerant sort) and a stepdaughter (the wife had a first husband who was <em>worse</em> than this guy?).</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Shit,&rsquo; I told her. &lsquo;Go visit your girlfriend in Orlando. How much fucking time do we need to spend together anyway?&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; I assumed he was talking about the wife.</p>

<p>His father didn&rsquo;t say a word, not even <em>uh-huh</em>. It was as if, for him, his son weren&rsquo;t there. And maybe he, like me and who knows how many others nearby, wished that could have been the case.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a prude &mdash; in fact, I learned plenty of salty language from my own father &mdash; but it hardly seemed right for this man to talk that way in public, with total disregard for the people around him. I&rsquo;m not sure, though, that his thoughtless swearing was at the bottom of why the encounter was so unsettling to me. I stood there, quick to judge, but I didn&rsquo;t utter a word of protest, nor did anyone else in line.</p>

<p>The young woman at the cash register scanned the father&rsquo;s items and asked to see an <span class="smallcaps">ID</span> for the bottle of wine. &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Company policy.&rdquo; She took his credit card, listened, as I did, to a few more <em>fuck</em>s and <em>shit</em>s from the son, gave the father his receipt, and with a smile told him to have a nice day.</p>

<p>I stepped up to pay for my own items, and the day shifted back to its regular routine.</p>

<p>Only I couldn&rsquo;t quite get the swearing man out of my mind. I&rsquo;d seen and heard much worse, but something about him was difficult for me to forget. I started to wonder why the universe had decided that I needed to be in that check-out line that day, a reluctant eavesdropper.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="dropcap">Once, when I was fourteen, I came home from being with friends and found my parents entertaining an elderly couple named Oat and Mabel, whom they knew from church. Oat was one of the church elders. A slack-faced man with pouches of loose skin under his eyes, he was tall and soft-spoken and smoked a pipe with a silver stem. Mabel was a trim woman who had her gray hair waved and set each week and laughed easily, throwing up her hands in delight. I&rsquo;d always felt comfortable around them, and their presence in our home didn&rsquo;t unsettle me, as a visit from certain other members of the church &mdash; the more proudly pious ones &mdash; would have.</p>

<p>It was a midsummer evening after the wheat harvest, a time of year when my father and I didn&rsquo;t have to work until dark on our farm. I&rsquo;d been racing bicycles with my friends at a dirt track we&rsquo;d built in a vacant lot. We&rsquo;d also sampled some Red Man chewing tobacco that one of my friends had stolen from his father, and, after deciding it wasn&rsquo;t to my liking, I&rsquo;d headed home.</p>

<p>An oscillating fan cooled the living room, where Oat and Mabel were visiting with my parents. Each time it turned toward the coffee table, it lifted the corner of a <em>Life</em> magazine cover, and Mabel smoothed the page back down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where you been?&rdquo; my father asked me.</p>

<p>I could have told the truth, but I didn&rsquo;t want him to find out about the Red Man, so I decided to be cryptic. &ldquo;Just screwing around,&rdquo; I said, and then I went on to my room.</p>

<p>Once Oat and Mabel were gone, my father called me into our kitchen and asked what I thought I was doing, using vulgar language in the company of decent folks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Screwing around,&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; he said with disgust. &ldquo;What kind of thing is that to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I should note here that he had often said much worse. He had a temper, and when it got the best of him, he let loose with a few <em>hell</em>s and <em>damn</em>s and <em>shit</em>s &mdash; on occasion a <em>son of a bitch</em> or a <em>goddamn</em>. But it was clear that my father&rsquo;s character wasn&rsquo;t on trial here. Even my always tolerant mother was looking at me with disapproval. Our narrow kitchen felt particularly cramped. My father sat at the chrome-edged dinette table, his jaw muscles flexing in anger. My mother stood with her hands on her hips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lee, you&rsquo;re better than language like that,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>My mother always told me that when people swore, it was partly because they wouldn&rsquo;t take the time to find the words they really wanted to use. She was a grade-school teacher, a woman of faith. The strongest oath I&rsquo;d ever heard her utter was <em>Oh, fiddle</em>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a word,&rdquo; I said feebly. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t mean anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It most certainly <em>does</em> mean something,&rdquo; my father said, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t act like you don&rsquo;t know what.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yes, I knew the sexual connotation of the word, but I also knew in my heart that I hadn&rsquo;t been using it that way when I&rsquo;d answered my father&rsquo;s question. I also knew that, no matter what I&rsquo;d <em>meant</em>, I&rsquo;d been wrong to say it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it a word you think Mabel or Oat would use?&rdquo; my mother asked in a soft voice.</p>

<p>I bowed my head and didn&rsquo;t answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you shouldn&rsquo;t use it around them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; I said, and it was the truth.</p>

<p>Although there would be times when I&rsquo;d forget this lesson, for the most part it stuck. It was a lesson the man in line at Walmart had never learned or, for whatever reason, had chosen to ignore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shit. She&rsquo;s carding you for the wine,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d said to his father, when the cashier had asked for identification. &ldquo;Can you believe that shit?&rdquo; he&rsquo;d asked, laughing. &ldquo;Holy fuck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="dropcap">In the days that followed that encounter, I thought of the poem &ldquo;Compassion,&rdquo; by my former teacher Miller Williams:</p>

<pre class="text-indent"><span class="poem-line">Have compassion for everyone you meet,</span>
<span class="poem-line">even if they don&rsquo;t want it. What seems conceit,</span>
<span class="poem-line">bad manners, or cynicism is always a sign</span>
<span class="poem-line">of things no ears have heard, no eyes have seen.</span>
<span class="poem-line">You do not know what wars are going on</span>
<span class="poem-line">down there where the spirit meets the bone.</span></pre>

<p>Even after recalling Williams&rsquo;s poem and feeling the gentle nudge of its guidance, I still felt a strong distaste for the man in the check-out line and the way he seemed to think that he was the only one in that store who mattered.</p>

<p>A few days later I went to my dentist&rsquo;s office for a cleaning and exam. I&rsquo;ve been going there for ten years and have gotten to know the staff: the Venezuelan dentist who runs marathons and reads Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez; the hygienist who enjoys gardening and cutting hair and has a daughter who&rsquo;s graduating from high school this year. They&rsquo;re pleasant women who laugh easily, and I enjoy seeing them even if it means a filling or a crown.</p>

<p>The one person I don&rsquo;t know as well is the receptionist, Christine. It&rsquo;s not because she&rsquo;s unfriendly, but because I spend the least amount of time in her company. Mostly she makes my next appointment and hands me a free toothbrush.</p>

<p>This morning I arrived early and parked in front of the building, near the steps that lead up to the office door. Before getting out of the car, I took the time to glance through some mail that I&rsquo;d grabbed from my box as I was leaving home.</p>

<p>When I finally looked up, I saw Christine standing on the landing by the door, giving me a playful grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was starting to think you&rsquo;d never see me,&rdquo; she said as I got out of my car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just taking my time,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I knew I was early.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a glorious August day, a few wisps of cirrus clouds in the sky. We&rsquo;d turned the corner toward autumn in central Ohio. Evenings were filled with the chirr of insects. Spiders were busy weaving webs across the yew bushes. Christine was wearing a white lab coat and a dark skirt that hung just above her knees. I came up the steps and asked how she&rsquo;d been.</p>

<p>When I was a college senior, I&rsquo;d had an English professor who was very direct. Once, when I&rsquo;d asked how he was, he&rsquo;d narrowed his eyes and said, &ldquo;Do you really want to know, or are you just making conversation?&rdquo; Still, I went on using the question as a casual hello with others, never really expecting anyone to open up and tell me what was happening with them.</p>

<p>But what I got from Christine was this: &ldquo;Oh, I haven&rsquo;t been too good.&rdquo; Her grin crumpled, and her lips quivered. &ldquo;My brother died last week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In that instant she invited me into her grief. Perhaps she was in so much pain she couldn&rsquo;t keep it inside. Or perhaps she had no patience with social conventions: if someone asks how she&rsquo;s been, she tells them, no matter if it&rsquo;s someone like me, who sees her two or three times a year and only long enough to transact the necessary business.</p>

<p>I struggled to find words with which to respond. I couldn&rsquo;t be mute the way I had been behind the man at Walmart. I had to say something, and I disappointed myself by falling back on a clich&eacute;d &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry&rdquo; &mdash; words that didn&rsquo;t really express what I was feeling inside. There, I was feeling <em>shit</em> and <em>fuck</em> and words even more vile than that. But of course I didn&rsquo;t say them. I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; and then there was a moment of silence. It&rsquo;s times like these when we feel how close we are to our fellow human beings, even strangers. We sense the common end we&rsquo;re moving toward day by day. We know the incapacity of language to rage against that fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had a heart attack.&rdquo; Christine lifted her hand to her mouth and lowered her head to gather herself. Then she looked at me with damp eyes. &ldquo;He was forty-two. He had a heart attack and died.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I opened my arms, and she moved into them without a word. We stood there for a moment as traffic went by on Main Street. The noon whistle blew at the firehouse. An airplane passed over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ,&rdquo; I finally said to her, and then I didn&rsquo;t know how to go on, because I&rsquo;d thought of something the man in Walmart had said when his father was paying for his purchases: &ldquo;Dad, I&rsquo;ll make this up to you once I&rsquo;m back on my feet.&rdquo; The voice he&rsquo;d used was softer, humbler. I wondered whether the son used vulgarities because the things he really wanted to say to his father were so intimate &mdash; so holy, residing as they did down where the spirit meets the bone &mdash; that they were beyond words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; I said again to Christine, &ldquo;life is .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She whispered, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so hard,&rdquo; finishing my sentence, making it her own.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was only then that I really heard the man who&rsquo;d sworn so openly that day in the check-out line. I hadn&rsquo;t heard him in the store &mdash; not really &mdash; though at the time I could have sworn I was listening to every word.</p>

			<p>Lee Martin&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;<a href="/article/4629">No Ears Have Heard</a>&rdquo; [February 2012] shows that true compassion can come only after we suspend our judgments and try to understand each other. He quotes his former teacher, poet Miller Williams: &ldquo;You do not know what wars are going on / down there where the spirit meets the bone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here in the penitentiary, vitriolic language, impulsive reactions, and violent behaviors are commonplace, a manifestation of the prisoners&rsquo; existential despair. I strive to keep in mind that most felons are undereducated and come from homes where they were subjected to neglect and abuse and had poor role models.</p>

<p>Suspending my self-righteous disgust and disapproval, I can often recognize the painful void where their &ldquo;spirit meets the bone.&rdquo;</p>
