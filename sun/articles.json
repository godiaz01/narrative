As he came down the hill off Grizzly Peak onto Claremont Avenue, the front tire of his Italian racing bike went flat. He went up on the embankment, riding on the rim. Then he lost control, went headfirst over the handlebars, and landed on his back, snapping his neck in the process.",

To Thoreau, the problem of finding one\u2019s right work and integrating it into other proper demands on one\u2019s life was a challenge that needed to be tackled early and with great energy if young adults weren\u2019t going to step blindly into traps that were indeed much easier to step into than to get out of.",

The standing army is only an arm of the standing government. The government itself, which is only the mode which the people have chosen to execute their will, is equally liable to be abused and perverted before the people can act through it. Witness the present Mexican war, the work of comparatively a few individuals using the standing government as their tool; for, in the outset, the people would not have consented to this measure.",

He sleeps on my optic nerve, is not always gracious; by sleeping too much and over indulgence in the proliferation of his own being he causes eye strain. I want to close my eye and rest. I want him off! I cry intently. May this beast be gone. I pray softly. But Chole that gluttonous fellow, Choleste that lascivious creature is here for a reason: to guide me, to help me transcend the bodily throes, and learn: there is no sidestepping life. You either deal with your stuff now or you deal with it later. It\u2019s hard. It hurts. But there is no getting around it. You might as well get on with it. I thank you two.",

I mean, whoever we are sometimes, they were too. Isn\u2019t this, after all, what most of the great teams have in common, not only that they win but that their winning comes to serve as a metaphor for our winning? This is where a fan\u2019s heart is truly involved. Who cares about a team which wins too easily? But a team that struggles to final victory, that is as capable of losing as we are and for all the same reasons \u2014 laziness, lack of concentration, failure to do the right thing at the right time \u2014 but which nevertheless, unlike all the other teams of similar talent, manages to win a national championship; why, that is a great team, even a wondrous team. And the victory of such a team always represents more than itself, which is why those of us who love competitive sports will laugh and cry at the game\u2019s end and will remember a well-played, high-stakes game in the same way that we remember a great poem or a novel.",

In October of 1977, the Idaho Supreme Court vacated my death penalty, but I\u2019m under review to receive a newly enacted death penalty in May of this year. At that time the courts will decide if I can be given the new death penalty or a double life sentence. These two charges in Idaho aren\u2019t the only ones I have. There are seven more in other states. Please let me explain why I did these cold-blooded, without any mercy, killings. In April of 1974, 11 men entered my home in Portland, Oregon, raped my 17 year old wife, who was three months pregnant at the time, then threw her four stories out our apartment window.",

        "excerpt": "The publication in 1974 of Joseph Blotner\u2019s Faulkner: A Biography was a literary event by default. The man whom many consider to have been America\u2019s greatest writer of prose fiction was the most private of individuals, who distorted and obscured most of the facts of his life; his biography had been awaited with much anticipation. Blotner\u2019s book fell on the literary world with all the grace of the wreck of the Hindenburg. A gigantic work \u2014 the boxed two-volume edition ran to 1846 pages \u2014 it contained a staggering amount of information, but treated its subject in a dully chronological way and with the most pedestrian of styles. Faulkner fans were ambivalent, delighted to have the new information, but sorry it couldn\u2019t have been embodied in a more distinguished form. It was also apparent that, because he had been authorized by Mrs. Faulkner, Blotner had treaded lightly around certain areas of Faulkner\u2019s life, around a marriage, for instance, that began with the bride making a serious attempt at suicide on the wedding trip. When, two years after Blotner\u2019s work, Meta Carpenter Wilder published A Loving Gentleman about her long and passionate affair with Faulkner, she was quick to point out that there had been scant reference to her in the Blotner book, and that Mrs. Faulkner, apparently out of malice, had failed to identify her in one of the book\u2019s photographs. More damningly, though, the reader of A Loving Gentleman couldn\u2019t help feeling \u2014 despite its banal title, its very ordinary writing and its occasional embarrassing attempts at flowery metaphor \u2014 that it contained more of the spirit of Faulkner than all of Blotner\u2019s 1800 pages.",

What seems to me most brilliant about this novel that is brilliant on every page is the place where it chooses to begin, on the warm summer Chicago night when David sets fire to the house of the girl, and the family, that he loves. He had been banned from the house for thirty days, apparently because his relationship with Jade Butterfield had grown so intense as to be almost dangerous, and he had hoped just to set a small fire, on the porch, so that the Butterfields would have to come out and he could see them (or was that all he intended? We soon realize in this novel that we are in the hands of a first person narrator, and have only his word concerning his motivations;\u00a0 others see things differently). The fire, however, has consequences he had never imagined. Scott Spencer seems to be taking up his narrative at the end, the end of a fabulous love story in which a boy falls hopelessly in love with a girl and, by extension, with her family, but really his story is not of that adolescent love, but of its consequences. The consequences are endless.",

What we ask of dialogue is not that it be authentic but that it seem so, and that it be lively, colorful, and interesting. Good dialogue does not reproduce speech, but imitates it, especially its rhythms, in a kind of shorthand. When a beginning writer with a sharp memory tries to reproduce speech, it is inevitably windy, lifeless, and dull.",

As much as he yearned for acceptance, he seemed to realize that a large measure of his inspiration lay in his alienated stance. Thus it was in the sixties, when he could be successful exactly because he was alienated, that his career really blossomed.",

When the surf got huge I got bashed and battered if l tried to hang on. The only thing to do was to swim free trusting my body and the water as I dove down under the turbulence of each breaking wave on my way out to deeper water. I remember a Sufi saying: \u201cThere are treasures beyond compare in the ocean. If you seek safety stay ashore.\u201d I also remember that I did not like to use a surfboard.

He believes that he writes lives in order to find direction in his own, and is ceaselessly didactic, but there is something dry and barren in all his teaching. A total stranger confesses that her husband is impotent, and the best that Dubin can do in the way of sympathy is to tell her that Mahler went to Freud with the same problem. About in the middle of the book, his wife is confessing an affair that came to nothing, and to his question \u2014 \u201cBut he wouldn\u2019t oblige?\u201d \u2014 she finally speaks out in anger, \u201cI hate the way you distance yourself from me.

To some, these are images from antiquity, symbols of superstition; to others, intimations of some cryptic alchemy, promising the transformation of consciousness. In astrology, which is the interface of nature and psychology, there are no symbols more fundamental than these four. The primal Elements are the bedrock from which all the elaborate symbolism of the birthchart arises. So transcendent are they in character that they are beyond the grasp of pure reason. Far more ethereal\u00a0than the twelve Signs, they stand in the same relation to our mental faculties as does the earth to our five senses: they are simply too large to conceive. ln school, most of us were taught that the philosophers of ancient days, in an effort to explain the universe, assumed that all creation was synthesized from various admixtures of fire, earth, air, and water in their physical forms. Our teachers then very likely went on to talk about how nowadays we know that there are not four ele- ments but over a hundred. All this is\u00a0typically presented in a condescending manner, as though Plato and his cronies were not dumb really, just uneducated. As is so often the case when crossing lines of time or culture, we have misconnected .

In loose diary form he writes of the place where he is living, his daily routine, his elaborately simple cuisine \u2014 making this one of the tastiest books in recent memory \u2014 and dWelling at some length on people and episodes from his past.

He is right. Sheed\u2019s novels as one reads them seem to be rendering a complete world: it is striking, leafing back through, to notice how little detail from the outside world there actually is. The vision he presents is complete. but it is the complete and idiosyncratic world that exists inside a man's skull. One moves through his narratives on the heels of a slick, sardonic sensibility, typically modern, that intellectualizes, verbalizes. everything, until it exists at one remove, mocking, ironic, more observing life than experiencing it. Though the situations and characters change, one finds the same sensibility in all the novels, and also in Sheed\u2018s remarkable essays, and reviews (some of which have been collected in a volume, entitled The Morning After). He is as accomplished a critic as he is a novelist, somehow managing to be aloof and urbane without being so at the expense of the artist. A sharp, difficult reviewer, he knows how to praise. His novels are often wildly funny, with a kind of humor that is even more striking on a second reading, once it has had time to sink in. He is not the life of the party, but the enormously; funny little man off in the corner whom only a few people know about. Admirers of Sheed \u2014 among whom I count myself \u2014 are perhaps first attracted by that witty idiosyncratic voice.",

He is most known in conventional medical history for his discovery of a new system of vaccination, less so for the herbal remedies he found to replace it. Early in his career, while working at the University College Hospital, and in private practice, he observed that the same treatment did not always cure the same disease in all his patients and that those with a similar personality would often respond to the same remedy. Conversely, those of a different temperament, though diagnosed as having the same disease, seemed to need a different remedy. He saw that many people were not cured; their pain was merely alleviated and their symptoms suppressed. He wished to find a simple method of healing the whole person, even those with diseases thought chronic and incurable. Bach realized that the majority of the medical profession was so concerned with the particular disease that they ignored anything other than the patient\u2019s bodily symptoms. The notion of psychosomatic medicine, that many bodily illnesses are mental in origin, had not yet become accepted. Dissatisfied, Bach began to look for other methods of healing and thus became interested in a branch of medicine called the Immunity School.",

Physical descriptions and details of the setting are held to a minimum. Exposition is also limited, and the prolonged digressions of early writers of fiction eliminated. The general rule of the short story, laid out early by Poe, is that no detail is to be included that does not contribute to the central effect. All these demands have had their effect on the development of the modern novel. As early as Hawthorne one can see writers beginning to subject their novels to the rigors of the shorter form. Especially in the twentieth century, many novelists have served their apprenticeships as short story writers, and at their best (as in John Cheever\u2019s Falconer, reviewed in the May issue) have produced lean concentrated works with all the weight of much larger volumes.",

In a crowded, bustling Page Auditorium, the dignitaries moved to the stage: a couple of professors from other universities, a writer on educational theory, the Stanford student body president (David Harris), a moderator, and the president of Duke, Douglas Knight, who was to give the opening address. With the hoardes of people, the name cards, microphones, podium, stage lights, popping flashbulbs, it seemed a most impressive event. Douglas Knight had been a Yale professor (when, two years later, I took his course in the European Epic Tradition, I found him a brilliant teacher), but he was a rambling talker, speaking on a subject I was unfamiliar with, and I let my mind wander, content vaguely to soak up the atmosphere.

Here was a man, given all his supposed violence, racism and provincialism, who expressed more of the South than any other poet \u2014 and as a poet, its soul \u2014 and surely within him, I thought, there would be those footnotes to Southernness: sin, redemption, and guilt.

In any event, he was looking forward to the conference coming to an end so that he might resume his inquiries into the religious Orient and its mystique.",

Since the approval (which is often confused with love) of parents, relatives, teachers, peers was so vital to our well-being, we learned to believe that what they thought was right for us was right. Not only did we believe it, we felt it. Behavior that many of us spontaneously enjoyed as children, such as loud boisterous playing, eating and sleeping when we wanted, and touching our genitals often met with disapproval and control. These once enjoyable activities (and anyone whose childhood memory is open can remember many ways that his or her activities were repressed \u2014 some successfully and some not) no longer gave us pure spontaneous pleasure. Fear, anxiety, guilt tainted the activities that we knew would meet disapproval, or else, consciously or unconsciously, we stopped doing what was deemed bad.

Preserved as a tradition in Tibet, it comes to us as a symbolic system describing Samsara, the unenlightened state of man caught in the web of his own illusion. It consists of four concentric circles. In the middle are the three obscuring passions (S. mula-klesa) which prevent us from seeing the world as it really is. The next circle is symbolic of the bardo, described in the Tibetan Book of the Dead as the home of the soul between incarnations. In the next circle the Six Realms (S. Lokas) of Rebirth are illustrated, and the outer circle depicts the Twelve Links in the Chain of Causality (S. Nidanas) whereby man continues to be reborn into life after life.",

Life is a state of becoming, and death is a part of this process of becoming. You are alive now, a consciousness knowing itself, sparkling with cognition amid a debris of dead and dying cells; alive while the atoms and molecules of your body die and are reborn. You are alive, therefore, in the midst of small deaths; portions of your own image crumble away moment by moment and are replaced, and you scarcely give the matter a thought. So you are to some extent now alive in the midst of the death of yourself \u2014 alive despite, and yet because of, the multitudinous deaths and rebirths that occur within your body in physical terms.",

In February of 1972 I dug to a depth of 425 feet and got one gallon a week. A few days later, with the help of a dowser, I dug 85 feet and found water flowing at seven gallons per minute.

The cruel irony of so many Americans on diets in a starving world is paralleled by our indulgence in revolutionary new architectures (everything from ecologically questionable domes to the towering monstrosities of the World Trade Center in New York) in a world where \u201chome\u201d can be anything from an abandoned car to a refugee tent. We may be indignant about hollow doors in new houses, built by carpenters forbidden by their unions to use a hammer heavier than fourteen ounces (which might speed up construction and make some union men expendable) and paid for by 30-year mortgages whose accumulated interest comes to twice the value of the house. But all this means about as much to a family living on the streets of Calcutta as the price of a Rembrandt to a blind man.

A channel is that by which something passes or is transmitted. The rocky river bed allows the rain waters to flow together on their passage to the sea.

A meal prepared for friends, a poem, a painting, a greeting are some of the ways we channel the gifts that make us who we are. I have frequently heard \u201cchannel\u201d used in an esoteric, awesome way, a channel being a unique someone who possesses difficult-to-attain knowledge of the most secret wisdoms of the universe.

I was at the office the other day and found out that Hargrove no longer runs the thing, instead a married couple named the Utnes, that weren\u2019t there. The whole staff went into the EST training program a few months ago, which is something of a rage about, since the training seems to cut through boundaries of age and class that haven\u2019t been broken down by any of the other integrating philosophies except maybe TM, which has gone so far as the front of TIME, which is probably about the farthest an alternative anything can go before it starts being something else. EST stands for Erhard Seminars Training, and they are run by the blue-eyed beauty Werner Erhard and his assistants, and are huge T-group type things where everyone learns to just be. Werner Erhard is not the guy\u2019s real name. In the article-interview in the New Age Journal, he says, \u201cIt\u2019s all a con .\u00a0.\u00a0. you can\u2019t avoid it,\u201d which includes himself, Werner Erhard (alias), who means that everything in your whole life is a con including the notion that you are an integral, separate human being who determines his whole life. For two hundred and fifty dollars, EST will con you out of believing that, and con you back into it. There is a great deal that I don\u2019t know about it, and many people, all kinds of people, think that the training has brought about profound changes in their lives.

There are reasons the Christ entity did not come as one person. For one, the full consciousness of such an entity would be too strong for one body. For another, the entity wanted a more diversified environment. In any event, the third personality of Christ, whose return has been prophesied as the \u201cSecond Coming\u201d (Matthew 24) will emerge soon. It will not, Seth says, signal the end of the world, as the prophecies have maintained. Also, the \u201cnew religion\u201d following the Second Coming will not be Christian, in our terms, although the Christian personality will originate it. A new era will, however, begin \u2014 not a heaven on earth but a more sane and just world, in which \u201cman is more aware of his relationship with his planet and of his freedom within time.\u201d Seth says:",

Expressing one\u2019s self is as real a human need as hunger. Yet, to avoid that nagging feeling that one is not saying what one means, one must first know who he is. Paradoxically, to solve that problem one must periodically abstain from communicating anything. That is, spending time alone the better to know one\u2019s self and to avoid the miring of the self in a swamp of superficiality. Everyone needs occasional refueling. There must be unimpinged upon time for experience to be digested, assessed and assimilated. Otherwise self-expression remains on a cliched level, while the soul, unheeded, yearns to grow through an expanded understanding of the universe through which the body is and has been moving.",

I have been morbidly depressed lately and thought that the company of a youthful, effervescent individual of the opposite sex might be of some comfort or, at least, diversion. I was quiet for the most part, preferring to listen more than speak. The young lady bubbled on about how the world would be a better place if people just stopped hating one another. She talked about how if you were just nice to people they would be nice back and there would not be any more conflict in the world. She talked about how she loved flowers, lasagna, and parties (in that order). After a while, I turned to her and said, \u201cYou\u2019re pretty idealistic, huh?\u201d She responded with a cheery, \u201cUh-huh!\u201d We departed for a favorite Italian restaurant where much of the remainder of the evening was spent discussing the young lady\u2019s dad and mom and all the good times which they had back on the farm. We ordered a pitcher of beer. My idealistic friend could really put it away. We left the piazza parlor for a party that was already in progress. People were dancing, drinking, and playing guitars. The young lady and I sat down and I picked up her hand and looked at it. She had one of the smoothest lifelines that I had ever seen. Her head and heart lines were also pretty weird looking. \u201cWhen someone hurts you do you just forget it after a while or act like it didn\u2019t happen?\u201d I asked her. \u201cHow didja know?\u201d I showed her, then left the room to look at the Eno River outside.",
